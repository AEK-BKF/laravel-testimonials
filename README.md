## Usage

Before goint through the code samples, we need to clarify the concepts behind this package and how it works. **Rinvex Testimonials** assumes that every testimonial has two relationships for two objects, first one is the entity giving the testimonial **(called attestant)**, and second one is the enity receiving it **(called subject)**. These entities could be anything, each and every testimonial stores `type` and `id` (both form a polymorphic relationship) for **subject** and **attestant**. An entity can give testimonials, receive testimonials, or both. It's up to you to decide. 

### Add testimonials functionality to your attestant model

To add support for a model to give testimonials simply use the `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\GivesTestimonials` trait:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\GivesTestimonials;

class User extends Model
{
    use GivesTestimonials;
}
```

### Add testimonials functionality to your subject model

To add support for a model to receive testimonials simply use the `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\TakesTestimonials` trait:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\TakesTestimonials;

class Company extends Model
{
    use TakesTestimonials;
}
```

Both traits could be used together for the same model without any issues.

### Create a new testimonial

Creating a new testimonial is straight forward, and could be done in many ways, use whatever suits your context. Let's see how could we do that:

```php
$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$company = \App\Models\Company::find(1);
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial');
$testimonialBody = 'I have been using this service as my main learning resource since it went live. I believe it has the best teaching material out there.';

// Create a new testimonial via subject model (attestant, body)
$company->newTestimonial($user, $testimonialBody);

// Create a new testimonial via attestant model (subject, body)
$user->newTestimonial($company, $testimonialBody);

// Create a new testimonial
$testimonial->make(['body' => $testimonialBody])
            ->subject()->associate($company)
            ->attestant()->associate($user)
            ->save();
```

### Query testimonial models

You can get more details about a specific testimonial as follows:

```php
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->find(1);

$subject = $testimonial->subject; // Get the owning subject model
$user = $testimonial->attestant; // Get the owning attestant model

$company = \App\Models\Company::find(1);
$testimonialsOfSubject = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->ofSubject($company)->get(); // Get testimonials of the given resource

$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$testimonialsOfUser = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->ofAttestant($user)->get(); // Get testimonials of the given user

$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$subject->testimonialsOf($user)->get(); // Get testimonials of the given user

$subject = \App\Models\Subject::find(1);
$user->testimonialsOf($subject)->get(); // Get testimonials by the user for the given subject
```

### Manage testimonials models

And now we can manage our testimonials easliy as follows:

```php
// Find an existing testimonial
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->find(1);

// Update an existing testimonial
$testimonial->update([
    'body' => 'This service has dramatically helped level up my experience. Those guys knows exactly how to break down advanced topics so they are not overwhelming!',
]);

// Delete testimonial
$testimonial->delete();

// Alternative way of testimonial deletion
$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$company = \App\Models\Company::find(1);
$company->testimonials()->where('id', 123)->first()->delete();

$company->testimonials; // Get attached testimonials collection
$user->recommendations; // Get attached recommendations collection

$company->testimonials(); // Get attached testimonials query builder
$company->recommendations(); // Get attached recommendations query builder
```
