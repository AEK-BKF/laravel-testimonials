# Rinvex Testimonials

**Rinvex Testimonials** is a Laravel package for managing testimonials. Customers can give you testimonials, and you can approve or disapprove each individually. Testimonials are good for showing the passion and love your service gets from customers, encouraging others to join the hype!

## Usage

To add testimonials support to your eloquent models simply use `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\HasTestimonials` trait.

### Create a new testimonial

Creating a new testimonial is straight forward, and could be done in many ways, use whatever suits your context. Let's see how could we do that:

```php
$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial');
$testimonialBody = 'I have been using this service as my main learning resource since it went live. I believe it has the best teaching material out there.';

// These are three different ways to add a new testimonial, and get the same result
$user->testimonials()->save($testimonial->fill(['body' => $testimonialBody]));
$testimonial->create(['user_id' => $user->id, 'body' => $testimonialBody]);
$user->testimonials()->create(['body' => $testimonialBody]);
```

### Query testimonial models

You can get more details about a specific testimonial as follows:

```php
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->find(1);

$user = $testimonial->user; // Get the owning user model
$user->testimonials; // Get attached testimonials collection
$user->testimonials(); // Get attached testimonials query builder
```

And as you may have expected, the underlying `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Models\Testimonial` model extends [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent) so you can manage these models fluently as you normally do.
